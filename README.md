## Synopsis: Why?
Let's get something out in the air right off the bat - Containerlab is awesome!
If you're looking at this repository, I probably don't need to espouse the use cases and benefits of
Containerlab compared to other network emulation platforms. That said, why not? Let's do it!

* Native support for containerized network operating systems (e.g., Arista cEOS, Cisco XRd, Nokia SR Linux)
* Easy sharing of labs (e.g., intrinsic Git integration)
* Lightweight/streamlined deployment model; "lab as code"

However, one annoyance of Containerlab (in its current form) is how it handles connections
to the containerized network devices running inside of labs. Since the management networking is handled
natively using the Docker bridge driver, it means that, by default, only the Containerlab host has access 
to the management IP addresses of the virtualized devices. Currently, Containerlab has no mechanism to map
the management port (e.g., SSH port) of the lab devices to a port on the Containerlab host's IP address via PAT/port forwarding.

This is fine if Containerlab is running directly on your client system (e.g., your laptop), but it becomes a significant
concern if you are trying to run Containerlab on a remote system (e.g., a beefier server with more resources to run more
demanding VM-based devices in labs). In this model, the client doesn't have access to the management IPs of the lab devices
connected to the Docker bridge. As such, how is the client machine supposed to launch an SSH session?

There are three main, recommended approaches:
* Launch an SSH session and obtain a shell on the Containerlab host. Within the remote shell, launch a second SSH session to the lab device.
  * This is the approach used by the SSH button in the Containerlab VS Code extension
* Use the `ports` directive in the Containerlab topology definition to map the SSH port of the lab device to a port on the IP address of the Containerlab host
* Specify the Containerlab host as an SSH jumphost (e.g., using the SecureCRT firewall option or the `-J` flag in the OpenSSH client) when connecting directly to the IP address/DNS hostname of the lab device

> There are also some deployments that have successfully configured the underlying network to route all management traffic
> for Containerlab-managed lab devices to the Containerlab host using the respective Containerlab management subnet (e.g., 172.20.20.0/24 by default). 
> However, for most deployments/networks, this presents a lot of unnecessary complexity. In most cases, this approach also
> prevents the use of the convenient DNS names generated by Containerlab, as those are directly stored on the hosts file of the Containerlab host.
> Additionally, you may also run into NAT issues with this approach, as Docker will, by default, NAT/masquerade all traffic on this management bridge.

These approaches all require a ton of manual labor; unless you are launching your connections to the lab devices using the buttons
in the VS Code extension, you'll have to create each session manually, more or less.

That's where the terminal launcher for Containerlab comes into play. Could I have thought of a more inventive name? Probably. But, boring name for a boring tool, am I right? :)

## Supported Features

### Features
* Highly customizable, but still easy to use - lots of options to allow this utility to work with all manner of Containerlab/terminal client environments
  * Supported terminal emulators:
    * [SecureCRT](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/) (preferred) - VanDyke Software
    * [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) (regular, windowed version) - open source by Simon Tatham
    * [MTPuTTY](https://ttyplus.com/multi-tabbed-putty/) (tabbed PuTTY-based client; Windows only) - TTYPlus
    * Native terminal + OpenSSH - OpenBSD Project, et al.
* Automated discovery of running Containerlab devices (either using the API or the output from `clab inspect`)
* Automated connection and launching of sessions to lab devices running in a Containerlab topology using DNS names, IPv4/IPv6 addresses, or the Containerlab host address
* Support for automated credential autofill with most connection/launch methods
* Support for defining environment variables for utility configuration to reduce time to use on subsequent occasions
* Support for Containerlab devices with custom SSH ports besides the default port 22 using a YAML file
* Comprehensive YAML-based credential definition file, complete with hierarchical specification by node name, image, kind, and default credentials (in decreasing order of precedence)
* Saves running node and lab data as a JSON file on disk, so you don't always need to retrieve the data prior to calling the `launch` command if the running nodes haven't changed
* Detailed console logging to display useful information during utility execution
* Complete error handling and input validation to ensure safe execution and clean/useful error messages - **as far as I'm aware at least, don't take this as a challenge please! :)**
* Lightweight footprint, with few external dependencies; pure Python, installation is as easy as running `pip install`!

### Caveats, Limitations, and Warnings
* **Only SSH is supported as a connection method at this time.** However, the utility's codebase is architected such that it would be fairly easy to expand beyond SSH, so that could change if the need arises!
* **When running `launch` commands on WSL 2 referencing a Windows executable, the CLI has a tendency to get messed up.** In most cases, you simply need to press Enter a few times to fix this. If that doesn't work, run the `reset` command. You can also just run the utility directly on Windows to avoid this issue.
* ***WARNING***: It is assumed that lab device passwords are **NOT** sensitive. They are stored in **PLAIN TEXT** inside of the credentials YAML file. Do **NOT** use a password that actually matters for your lab devices!!!

## Installation

There are a few requirements for installing and using the clab terminal launcher:
* Containerlab must be installed (duh, haha) - tested on the latest 0.73 release
  * It'll likely work on prior versions too, I'm not aware of any breaking API changes
* Python 3.12 or later must be installed
* Your terminal emulator of choice must be installed

Before installing the utility, **it's HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** that you first create a dedicated Python virtual environment 
for it using whichever method you prefer (e.g., Astral's uv, the native venv module, etc.) Using uv (`uv venv <name>`) 
is personally my favorite method. This will allow you to isolate the terminal launcher installation and its dependencies 
from other Python packages on your system.

From there, after activating your virtual environment (check out Python's documentation for more details on how to do this using
your specific OS/platform), you just need to run `pip install clab-terminal-launcher`. That's it!

Here's an example of doing it on my Linux system:

(**NOTE**: as shown, uv users need to run `uv pip install` instead of plain `pip install` - not a big deal!)
```bash
kelvintr@KTP-WNDS-WK01:~/test$ uv venv clab-term-launcher-example

## Usage

Two things can be true at once. For example, the Sun is bright and sushi is also objectively the best food on the planet!
Oh, and while we're at it, this utility is simultaneously extremely customizable **AND** also extremely easy to use.

There's a lot of commands, but that's only because there's a lot of intended pathways you can take to use this utility.
Before you go on, there's four decisions you need to make:

1. **Retrieval method** - how do you want this utility to retrieve data about running nodes in Containerlab? You can either enable the Containerlab API and allow the utility to query it or provide the utility a file containing the output from `clab inspect`
2. **Launch method** - what terminal emulator do you want to use? How do you want this utility to launch the sessions? You can choose from any of the supported options listed in the [Features](#features) section.
3. **Custom ports or default ports?** - have you defined custom port mappings (e.g., for SSH) for your lab devices in your Containerlab topology definition?
4. **Manual commands or shortcut command?** - do you want to run each of the required commands to execute the decisions you made above (good for one-off cases) or do you want to build a configuration file containing the settings for all of those decisions that you can easily reuse for multiple subsequent uses (even across different labs)?

We'll outline the steps to take for all of the possible answers to these four questions/decisions. *You don't need to
look at all of them, unless you want to!* Feel free to jump to the sections that are relevant to the decisions that
you made.

### Command Reference

The command structure of the utility is `clab-terminal-launcher <commands> <options>`. For any command, the `--help`
option is available to show helpful descriptions of the command and its associated options.

For all of the following sections, the following table of base/root-level commands will be helpful to keep in mind:

| Command   | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| launch    | Contains manual commands to initiate/control automatic launching of sessions/connections to running lab devices                                                                 |
| node-data | Contains manual commands to initiate/control data retrieval/manipulation for running nodes in Containerlab                                                                      |
| quick     | Automatic command to run all commands required to launch sessions/connections to running lab devices, based on the behavior/settings defined in the provided configuration file |           

Note that `launch` and `node-data` are not runnable commands in and of themselves, but rather just groupings for the 
subcommands that are actually runnable.

**launch subcommands**

| Command        | Purpose                                                                                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| securecrt      | Use SecureCRT to automatically launch sessions/connections to running lab devices                         |
| putty          | Use PuTTY to automatically launch sessions/connections to running lab devices                             |
| mtputty        | Create sessions in the MTPuTTY configuration to be used when launching connections to running lab devices |
| native-openssh | Use a native terminal + OpenSSH to automatically launch sessions/connections to running lab devices       |

**node-data subcommands**

| Command              | Purpose                                                                                                         |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| retrieve-from-api    | Automatically retrieve running lab devices from the Containerlab REST API                                       |
| parse-inspect-output | Process `clab inspect` output to find details about running lab devices                                         |
| inject-custom-ports  | Inject customized ports into the data file used by the utility containing information about running lab devices |

### File Reference

#### Configuration File (Environment Variables)

#### Custom Ports

For this feature to work, a YAML file must be defined and provided to the utility using the following format, replacing 
the occurrences of `<lab name #>`, `<node name #>`, and `<port>` with their respective values based on your environment:
```yaml
<lab name 1>:
  <node name 1>:
    ssh: <port>
  <node name 2>:
    ssh: <port>
<lab name 2>:
  <node name 1>:
    ssh: <port>
  <node name 2>:
    ssh: <port>
```

### Manual Command: API Retrieval

This is the preferred and easiest way to get data about the running nodes in Containerlab.
This relies on the `clab-terminal-launcher node-data retrieve-from-api` command. Using this command, the utility will
query the REST API of the Containerlab host and automatically retrieve, parse, and format the data into the required
structure for the other functions in the utility (e.g., `inject-custom-ports` and `launch` subcommands) to utilize.

In order for this command to work, the Containerlab API must first be started and accessible over HTTP. 
To confirm this, run the `clab tools api-server status` command. Your output should look something like this:

```
kelvintr@ktl-clab-svr01:~/labs$ clab tools api-server status
╭─────────────────┬─────────┬───────────┬──────┬──────────┬─────────┬──────────╮
│ NAME            │ STATUS  │ HOST      │ PORT │ LABS DIR │ RUNTIME │ OWNER    │
├─────────────────┼─────────┼───────────┼──────┼──────────┼─────────┼──────────┤
│ clab-api-server │ running │ localhost │ 8080 │ ~/.clab  │ docker  │ kelvintr │
╰─────────────────┴─────────┴───────────┴──────┴──────────┴─────────┴──────────╯
```

If it's not started, run the `clab tools api-server start` command to start it. 

Another thing you'll need is the credentials for the API server. By default, the API server relies on the Linux
credentials of users in the `clab_admins` or `clab_api` groups. **Since these are real Linux credentials on the
Containerlab host, it's recommended that you provide the credentials (at least the password) to the utility in 
a secure form (i.e., via interactive authentication or an environment variable).** 

Refer to the documentation for the Containerlab API server for more details regarding the behavior of the API.

The following parameters are available:

### Manual Command: "clab inspect" Output

As an alternative to the API method, if enabling and accessing the Containerlab API from your client machine is 
untenable (e.g., due to firewall/security restrictions for HTTP traffic), you can also feed the utility a text file
containing the output from `clab inspect`, which is included in the command set in the terminal of the actual 
Containerlab host itself.

The manual command for this method is `clab-terminal-launcher node-data parse-inspect-output`.

To use this method, you must first obtain the `clab inspect` output by running any one of the following variations of
this command on your Containerlab host:
* **Show all deployed labs** - `clab inspect --all --details`
* **Show all deployed labs in a particular path (e.g., a directory)** - `clab inspect -t <path> --details`
* **Show only one deployed lab specified by name** - `clab inspect --name <lab name> --details`

It is worth noting that `--details` is **VERY IMPORTANT**, no matter which variation of the command you use, as it
tells the `clab inspect` command to format the output using JSON, as opposed to the normal human-readable format. This
is what allows the utility to process the data.

From there, you can either:
* Redirect the data into a file (e.g., `clab inspect --all --details > labs.json`) and copy
that file to the client machine running this utility
* Copy the command output from the terminal (i.e., stdout) to a file on your client machine running the utility - likely faster if you are connected to the terminal of a remote Containerlab host via SSH

You'll need to provide the path/name of this file to the utility using the `--inputfile/-i` options, as discussed in the table below.

The following parameters are available:

| Parameter (Long + Short Names) | Required | Default (if applicable) | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|--------------------------------|----------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| --host, -h                     | No       | localhost               | If the Containerlab host is remote (i.e., not localhost), must be used to specify the IP address/DNS name of the Containerlab host to be used during the connection to the lab devices if the utility is configured to connect via the real Containerlab host address) |
| --inputfile, -i                | Yes      | N/A                     | Used to specify the JSON file containing the `clab inspect` output required for the command to operate, as discussed above                                                                                                                                             |
| --outputfile, -o               | Yes      | N/A                     | Used to specify the path/name of the file that will be used to store the rendered/parsed running node data generated by this command and used by other commands in the utility (examples listed above)                                                                 |

### Manual Command: Port Customization (Optional)

If your Containerlab topology definition file has a custom port mapping configured that must be observed when forming
the connection/session to the lab device, the `clab-terminal-launcher node-data inject-custom-ports` must be used
**AFTER** running the manual **retrieval** command for your respective method (e.g., API/inspect output), but **BEFORE**
running the manual **launch** command for your respective method (e.g., SecureCRT).

An example of a Containerlab topology definition file with this setting is included, for your reference:

```yaml
topology:
  nodes:
    srl1:
      kind: nokia_srlinux
      type: ixrd1
      image: ghcr.io/nokia/srlinux:latest
      ports:
        - 2500:22
```

As shown in the parameters table below, a YAML file containing the custom ports for the running lab nodes/devices must
be provided. The format for creating this YAML file is illustrated in the [Custom Ports](#custom-ports) section of the
file reference.

**IMPORTANT NOTES**:
* In your YAML file, you only need to include lab devices/nodes that are actually using custom port numbers
* **If you are using the default ports (e.g., 22 for SSH), you do NOT need to run this command.**

The following parameters are available:

| Parameter (Long + Short Names) | Required | Default (if applicable) | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| --output, -o                   | No       | Same as datafile        | Specify the output path for the new rendered JSON file containing the custom port numbers for use by other commands (e.g., launch commands); only needed if you don't want to replace the original data file, the value for this option CANNOT be the same as the value of the datafile option |

### Manual Command: Launching with SecureCRT

If you're using SecureCRT as your terminal emulator of choice, then the `clab-terminal-launcher launch securecrt` manual
command is exactly what you're looking for!

**If you are using a jumphost (e.g., your Containerlab host) to connect to your lab devices**, note that you will first
need to create a session inside of the SecureCRT session database and define all of the settings for the connection to
the jumphost prior to running this command. This is the session you will reference in the `--session/-s` option, as
discussed in the table below.

The following parameters are available:

| Parameter (Long + Short Names) | Required | Default (if applicable) | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

For example, if clab is a session stored in f2, which is a folder nested inside of an outer folder f1, you should provide **f1\f2\clab** as the value of this option |

### Manual Command: Launching with PuTTY

Automatically launching sessions using regular ol' PuTTY (i.e., one session per window) is as simple as using the
`clab-terminal-launcher launch putty` manual command.

**If you are using a jumphost (e.g., your Containerlab host) to connect to your lab devices**, note that you will first
need to create a session inside of the PuTTY session database and define all of the settings for the connection to
the jumphost prior to running this command. This is the session you will reference in the `--session/-s` option, as
discussed in the table below.

The following parameters are available:

| Parameter (Long + Short Names) | Required | Default (if applicable) | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Manual Command: Launching with MTPuTTY

Are you on Windows? Do you like that PuTTY is free, but hate that it doesn't support multiple tabs/sessions in a single
window? If you said yes to all of these, consider using MTPuTTY! This utility supports MTPuTTY using the
`clab-terminal-launcher launch mtputty` command.

There is one caveat with the support for MTPuTTY in this utility: due to limitations with the available command-line
options for MTPuTTY, **there's no way for this utility to automatically launch sessions in MTPuTTY** (at least as far as
I'm aware). Instead, this utility directly modifies the session database in the MTPuTTY configuration to populate all
relevant information (e.g., lab node address, jumphost information, username, and password) in the session associated
with each lab device. 

This significantly reduces the manual labor required to create the sessions/connections to the
lab devices, but you will still need to manually open MTPuTTY after the utility has executed and launch the newly created
sessions from the list in the left-hand sidebar of the MTPuTTY GUI.

Note that, under the hood, MTPuTTY relies on the base PuTTY utility for establishing connections; MTPuTTY effectively
just wraps PuTTY in a tabbed GUI. As such, both need to be installed. Additionally, as is the case with the native
PuTTY option, if a jumphost is needed, the settings for the jumphost session must be defined and saved in the native 
PuTTY GUI as a PuTTY session. This is the PuTTY session that will be referenced in the `--session/-s` parameter, as
discussed in the table below.

The following parameters are available:

| Parameter (Long + Short Names) | Required | Default (if applicable)       | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| --inputfile, -i                | Yes      | N/A                           | Specify the path/name of the rendered JSON file containing the data about the running lab devices generated by other commands in this utility (e.g., node data retrieval commands)                                                                                                                            |
| --method, -m                   | No       | dns                           | Specify one of the following methods for connecting to the lab devices in Containerlab: "**dns**" (the DNS hostname of the lab device, e.g., clab-test-srl1), "**ipv4**" (the IPv4 address of the lab device, e.g., 172.20.20.1), or "**ipv6**" (the IPv6 address of the lab device, e.g., 3fff:172:20:20::2) |
| --config, -f                   | No       | %appdata%\TTYPlus\mtputty.xml | Specify the path/name of the mtputty.xml file used as the MTPuTTY configuration file; the utility will create the sessions to the lab devices within this configuration file and save the new contents back to this file                                                                                      |
| --session, -s                  | No       | N/A                           | If using the Containerlab host as a jumphost, specify the session name, as defined in PuTTY, for the connection to the Containerlab host/jumphost.                                                                                                                                                            |

### Manual Command: Launching with native OpenSSH

If you'd rather not use a separate terminal emulator and instead rely on the OpenSSH client (i.e., the `ssh` command)
and your native terminal of choice (e.g., Windows Terminal, macOS terminal, one of a million options for Linux 
terminals, etc.), that's fine! This utility supports that too, using the `clab-terminal-launcher launch native-openssh`
command.

Due to technical limitations in the capabilities of the OpenSSH client, password autofill is not available. **If
you choose to use this option, the required credentials option (discussed below) will only be used to find and autofill

| --executable, -e               | No       | ssh                     | Specify the path/name of the executable for OpenSSH (i.e., the command used to run the OpenSSH client) that will be used in the command to automatically launch sessions to lab devices; it's recommended that you confirm this is a valid command by typing it into the terminal/your shell and ensuring that the OpenSSH client runs                                                                                                                                                                                 |

This will be used as the **-J** option in the SSH command                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --terminal, -t                 | Yes      | N/A                     | Specify the full command for the executable of the terminal that is being used; the format `<terminal command> <ssh command>` is assumed, meaning that the SSH command for each node that is automatically generated by this utility will be placed after the terminal command you provide in this option; your terminal must support that format (most do!) for this option to work.<br><br>Note that your terminal command should include any flags needed, such as the ones to launch each SSH session in a new tab |

### Shortcut/Quick Command

Do the other options sound like a bigger hassle than they're worth, with all of those manual commands? No worries!
This utility also has a shortcut command that is able to automatically trigger any of the other commands, based on
the settings you define in a configuration file. The command for this is `clab-terminal-launcher quick`. That's it!

As discussed below, there is one parameter to specify a configuration file, but if you use the default location
(`config.env` in the current directory), you don't need to specify any parameters/options at all!

Of course, the configuration file is the center of the world for this entire command. Reference the 
[Configuration File (Environment Variables)](#configuration-file-environment-variables) section in the
[File Reference](#file-reference) for more details about all of the available options and required format for this
configuration file.
